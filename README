CMPT300 A1 part 2
my_shell.c written by Ka Shun (Jason) Chan, ksc19@sfu.ca

instruction to compile my_shell.c:
1) cd into the location of proc_parse.c and Makefile
2) type "make" in the command console
3) done; the executable is "shell.exe"

work flow:
- ask user for command input
- parse input string into tokens
- check for internal commands "exit" and "cd"
- if true: methods are implemented and then loop back to the start
- if not: - parse tokens into a 2-D array seperated by pipe symbol "|"
          - call fork()
          - start child process which executes the user command
          - iterate until all commands have been executed
          - exit loop and go back to start
